            Our client is the rising band, Hellmist Dragonfire. The band consists of five members and has been active
            for 5 years, but have yet to see the wave of fame. The band consists of one vocalist, Jane Javelin, the next
            door girl from Dallas, Texas. At 54 years of age, her biggest wish is to become a popstar like Britney
            Spears and perform in Madison Square Garden. The drummer’s name is Randy - also known as Randolph Gregorian
            the third. Randy’s highest ambition is fame. Harrison and Morrison Horde are the twins who play guitar and
            bass. These shy boys are only in the band to make enough money so that they can open their own winery in
            Tuscany. Hellmist Dragonfire is on the rise, and their mutual goal to become famous drives their motivation.
            The band has realized that the only way to be a successful musician in the current day and age is to have a
            strong and well calculated internet presence.

            The goal of the website is to promote their upcoming tours, sell merchandise and give their fans easy access
            to information about albums and singles, present and future. The band wants the fans to be able to look back
            on previous tours to get them excited about the next one. This is achieved through an gallery tab on the
            webpage. They also want the information about the upcoming tours to be readily available on the site. In
            addition to promoting the bands activities they also want to give the fans a chance to see a more personal
            side of the band members. This is done through our bios tab, this is updated daily. To get people even more
            excited about their music the band also wants there to be a tab that promotes the albums and singles they
            have released.

            The typical user of this website will be the average Hellmist Dragonfire fan. Hellmist Dragonfire has fans
            all over the world, and thus the website needs to appeal to a set of different people from different
            cultures. Also, these fans are not know to be the sharpest knives, which means the website needs to be very
            user friendly. The user will likely want to know dates of tours and when the new album will be released as
            well as a way to get to know the members of the band better.  Also, if something is unclear, they will want
            contact info for where they shall send their questions.
