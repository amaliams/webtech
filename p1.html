            Our client is the rising band, Hellmist Dragonfire. They have been active for about 5 years, but have yet to see the wave of fame. The band consists of one vocalist, Jane Javelin, the next door girl from Dallas, Texas. At 54 years of age, her biggest wish is to become a popstar like Britney Spears and perform in Madison Square Garden. The drummer’s name is Randy - also known as Randolph Gregorian the third. Randy’s highest ambition is to be surrounded by girls. Previously, Randy has had a questionable reputation, mostly because of his STDs, which keep returning - much to Randy’s surprise. Harrison and Morrison Horde are the twins who play guitar and bass. These shy boys are only in the band to make enough money so that they can open their own winery in Tuscany. Hellmist Dragonfire is on the rise, and their mutual goal to become famous gives them an unusual spirit and great motivation.
