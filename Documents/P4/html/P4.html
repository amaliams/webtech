        <p>
            We have create a google form to go along with our testing procedure, and was sent out together to the subject of our testing. 
            The google form will include questions that are applicable to all websites in general as well as specific to our website. 
            All in all, the form was divided into 5 different part, where each part contributes to each type of questions. The first part 
            asks the subject general information about themselves so that we have a clue of what kind of subject we have at hand. The second 
            part asks the subject specific information to conclude if they are the right audience for our website, questions such as what type 
            of music they listen to and their music purchasing habit. The third part will try to find out if a certain feature on a website is 
            tolerable or desired by the subject. The fourth part will asks questions regarding the testing of our website such as compatibility,
            intelligibility and how likeable the website was. Finally, in the fifth part, we ask if there is anything else we haven’t brought up.
            By combining all the results we should get a pretty good picture of the test audience.

        Tester Audience:
    </h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>
            Our page is aimed at a somewhat older demographic, and it is important that the bands old and loyal fans can navigate the page 
            without frustration. However one of the goals of the page is to recruit a younger crowd. There were a challenge reaching the older 
            demographics and for this survey this demographics is represented by our different families. This of course is an issue for the 
            survey as our families has a somewhat higher education that our target demographics and also families can bee byes. As for the 
            younger crowd that Hellmist dragonfire is trying to reach with this page we have been able to reach some in this target demographics. 
            Of course we have to keep in mind that a lot of our subjects are students at NTNU. In the end we were able to reach 36 subjects in 
            total. of them 28 were students and 8 were family members; 6 parents and 2 uncles.

            The feedback was positive there were some comments on the color scheme, and the navigation from tours.html to shop.html was a 
            bit fast and you can be surprised by the link when you press it.

        <p>
            In a further development of this project we would have made sure the the link from tours to shop was better communicated in 
            the user interface. When it comes to the color scheme we feel that it’s the band's decision however we would bring our concerns 
            to the band to help them make an informed decision.

            <h3>Group dynamics:</h3>
            As a group we have managed to include every body and there has always been a kultur were there is allowed to come up with ideas 
            and talk them over with the rest of the group. this has lead to many productive exchanges of opinions that have shaped our project.   

            <h3>Workflow:</h3>
            From the start the group have started on the deliverables well ahead of the deadlines this has helped to make the workflow more 
            flexible for the members. This has also decreased the stress level in the group and have helped to keep the conflikt level at a 
            minimum. However we have had to issues with our workflow. The flexible work schedule has hindered effective communication and is 
            two getter with the fact that everyone in the group is late to the group meetings makes it hard to know that everyone is up to speed. 

            <h3>Cooperation:</h3>
            In terms of cooperation we have both worked separately and to getter in the group. There is and always have been easy to ask for help. 
            However in this group the members are very independent. Is makes us think of our own work sessions as very effective there is always 
            focus on the project when we meet up and we manage to limit the smalltalk.   
  

            <h3>What could have gone better:</h3>
            There are many things we could have done better after looking back at the beginning group project. One of the biggest mistake that 
            still hunts us is time management. Quickly after starting the project, we got lost in the deadline trap were we had to push the 
            deadline one after the other. We underestimated the amount of work in the other subjects and the intrusion it has on this project. 
            And to fix this, we need to have better communication between group members and act according to each other’s need in time outside 
            the project. In this way, we could at least avoid a deadline trap that chokes us at the last deadline. Other aspects of the project 
            that we could have done better adhere to specific things such as better understanding of the scope of the project before we even 
            start on it. Assign roles to each member of the team. For instance, in the beginning we wasted a lot of time at looking for a room 
            rather than actually working. To better manage the team we could have assigned a role in the team that is responsible for booking 
            rooms.

            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            In the end, we believe this was a good exercise to practice our web technology knowledge. Additionally, we learned a lot in team 
            management where we helped each other when anyone in the team had a problem. We also made a lot made a lot of mistakes that serves 
            to teach us how to do less of it. In the end, nobody in the group finishes without thinking that we learning a lot from the project.
