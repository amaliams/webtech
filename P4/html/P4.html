            HER SKAL VI SKRIVE NOE OM TESTINGEN VI GJENNOMFØRERThe purpose of the website is to create a closer link between the band and their fans. To intrigue new
            followers and create a lager fan base. The web site will also supply fans with music and products to
            increase the Hellmist Dragonfire fever that it gripping the world. The site also supply the fans with
            information about that they have and are doing in terms of day to day and big tours. Our audience is new
            fans and old fans; people how have been to a concert or just heard a song they liked and want to get to know
            the band. Their fans are mainly from Canada, USA and Western Europe, even though there is quite a large fan
            group forming in South-Korea at the moment. Their ages vary a lot as well, the youngest fans being about 15
            years old, while the oldest are in their 60s. However, they all have rock music and Hellmist Dragonfire in
            common. Thus, the website needs to be user friendly, because our target demographic consists of people who
            may not be used to websites and internet. Agents will also find contact information and a first impression
            if they are looking to book the band for different gigs.

            We have chosen to use the clique navigation structure(image shown below) for our client’s website. This
            allows
            the users to navigate throughout the page with much greater freedom than hierarchical structure. Users can
            go
            from one page to another by using the navigation bar on top of the window, and the navigation bar re-appears
            on
            every sub-sites giving users the ability switch site anytime they want. On the left end of the navigation
            bar is
            where our client’s logo sits which also acts as a button to return to home page.

            For the universal design we only use a thin navigation bar and a footer. Our main priority is the band and
            giving
            the visitors a good impression of them. therefor we only use a very simple navigation bar with a clean look
            that
            lets you know where you are on the site and how to move wherever you want in a single step. The band is in
            focus
            and we have designed the navigation bar and footer to take the least amount an attention away from the
            content of
            the page while still being easy to use. We feel at a simple to use web page with a dark color scheme fits
            well
            with the band’s graphic design and logos, and will appeal to our demographic while helping them navigate
            with there
            limited technical skills.

            When users first visit the website they will be greeted our home page. Our home page must therefore create a
            good
            first impression to attract and keep the users engaged on our website. With that being said, we will include
            a large
            slideshow of images which covers the whole window to capture the users’ attention as well as keep them up to
            date
            with the latest events.

            Although the requirement only specify 4 distinct javascript implementations, we have included more than that
            as
            a challenge for ourselves, however, we might consider dropping some if the workload turns out beyond our
            expectations. With that being said, here is a list of our javascript implementations.

            Everyone on the group will have to follow the following plan which includes what to do and deadline for when
            to
            complete. The task are mostly divided by our organizational scheme, but we will make changes according to
            situation.
            To better control the course of our project, we would include two “control meetings” to gather together for
            follow
