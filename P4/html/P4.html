            HER SKAL VI SKRIVE NOE OM TESTINGEN VI GJENNOMFØRERThe purpose of the website is to create a closer link between the band and their fans. To intrigue new
            followers and create a lager fan base. The web site will also supply fans with music and products to
            increase the Hellmist Dragonfire fever that it gripping the world. The site also supply the fans with
            information about that they have and are doing in terms of day to day and big tours. Our audience is new
            fans and old fans; people how have been to a concert or just heard a song they liked and want to get to know
            the band. Their fans are mainly from Canada, USA and Western Europe, even though there is quite a large fan
            group forming in South-Korea at the moment. Their ages vary a lot as well, the youngest fans being about 15
            years old, while the oldest are in their 60s. However, they all have rock music and Hellmist Dragonfire in
            common. Thus, the website needs to be user friendly, because our target demographic consists of people who
            may not be used to websites and internet. Agents will also find contact information and a first impression
            if they are looking to book the band for different gigs.

        <p>
                Our page is is meant for a diverse demographic and must answer the demands of our technology savvy younger 
                crowd while still being so intuitive that our older fans don’t get frustrated by all the complex shortcuts 
                and icons. There were a challenge reaching the older demographics and for this survey this demographics is 
                represented by our different families. This of course is an issue for the survey as our families has a somewhat 
                higher education that our target demographics and also families can bee byes. As for the younger crowd that 
                Hellmist dragonfire is trying to reach with this page we have been able to reach alot more in this target 
                demographics. of course we have to keep in mind that a lot of our subjects are students. In the end We were 
                able to reach 36 subjects in total. of them 28 were students at NTNU and 8 were family members; 6 parents 
                and 2 uncles.

            Although the requirement only specify 4 distinct javascript implementations, we have included more than that
            as
            a challenge for ourselves, however, we might consider dropping some if the workload turns out beyond our
            expectations. With that being said, here is a list of our javascript implementations.

            Everyone on the group will have to follow the following plan which includes what to do and deadline for when
            to
            complete. The task are mostly divided by our organizational scheme, but we will make changes according to
            situation.
            To better control the course of our project, we would include two “control meetings” to gather together for
            follow
            up and organize possible changes.
