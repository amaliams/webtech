            Navigation structure
        </h2>
        <div class="text" >
            <p>
                We have chosen to use the clique navigation structure(image shown below)  for our client’s website. This allows
                the users to navigate throughout the page with much greater freedom than hierarchical structure. Users can go
                from one page to another by using the navigation bar on top of the window, and the navigation bar re-appears on
                every sub-sites giving users the ability switch site anytime they want. On the left end of the navigation bar is
                where our client’s logo sits which also acts as a button to return to home page.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are mainly two reasons for why we think this navigation structure is best for this website. First, as
                mentioned above, it gives the users more freedom of navigation, thus omitting the chance of users getting
                confused or bored. Second, this structure is also comparatively intuitive, being used by many websites worldwide,
                which encourage the users to go to all sites in the domain.
                <br>
                <br>
                This structure is particularly useful because it’s simple to navigate throughout the various elements of the
                website. Ideally the band wants the fans to be able to easily jump from one section to any other and this has a
                higher priority than having a very stylized website. The structure is very intuitive, as stated earlier and will
                not be confusing to fans of any ages.

            Page Layout and Appearance
        </h2>
        <div class="text" >
            <p>
                For the universal design we only use a thin navigation bar and a footer. Our main priority is the band and giving
                the visitors a good impression of them. therefor we only use a very simple navigation bar with a clean look that
                lets you know where you are on the site and how to move wherever you want in a single step. The band is in focus
                and we have designed the navigation bar and footer to take the least amount an attention away from the content of
                the page while still being easy to use. We feel at a simple to use web page with a dark color scheme fits well
                with the band’s graphic design and logos, and will appeal to our demographic while helping them navigate with there
                limited technical skills.

            Content
        </h2>
        <div class="text" >
            <p>
                <h4>Home page - main.html</h4>
                When users first visit the website they will be greeted our home page. Our home page must therefore create a good
                first impression to attract and keep the users engaged on our website. With that being said, we will include a large
                slideshow of images which covers the whole window to capture the users’ attention as well as keep them up to date
                with the latest events.
                <br>
                <br>
                When scrolled down, the users will encounter a short news section where they could find more information about the
                latest events and announcement. Each of the news segment will have its own picture to the left, and the text should
                be short and concise. The goal is to give the users an intuitive and simplistic UI.
                <br>
                <br>
                The navigation bar should have a height of 90px, while the footer’s height will depend on the content we choose to
                include, for instance, contact information, our clients logo, address, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Footer will
                act a portal for links outside of our website.

                <br>
                <h4>Shop - shop.html</h4>
                In this section the shop section the first thing the user sees is a rotating gallery of different things and special
                offers they can buy. We have chosen to divide the page into three different parts one for music one for different
                merchandise called items and one called tickets as seen  in the picture above. When you press any one of the tickets,
                items or music buttons above you immediately change the content of the page underneath. For example if the ticket
                button is pressed all the different concerts comes to view. You then simply press the picture with the image and
                concert name on it to see all the relevant details and make a purchase.
                <br>
                <br>
                The rotating pictures is the first thing the user sees and will show of the best offers available. this will also
                help the user see what is new from the last time he or she visited the page. Because the shop section contains a lot
                of information we have chosen til divide it into different sub sections. this is to avoid presenting the user with
                to much information at once and risking they be put off. When the different tabs are opened we have organised the
                information in a manner that makes it easy to see what is available and you can check out the different offers while
                staying on the same page the relevant information simply becomes visible or invisible by the press of a button.

                <h4>About - about.html</h4>
                This about page will provide information of the band’s history and its member in detail. On top and first on the
                page is the pictures of every member of the band. Clicking on a picture will send to the corresponding biography
                of the member. Further down is the history of the band, which goes through the early days of the band and how they
                started up to the bands position today. A timeline might be included (depends on workload) to further enhance the
                experience. Below the history of the band, comes a short biography of each of the members. Each of the biography
                should be short and concise to go along with the theme of the website.
                <br>
                <br>
                The goal of the page is of course to give users an introduction to Hellmist Dragonfire. The website will use
                extensive amount of pictures to tell the story of the band. The layout of the page is meant to give the users a
                tour through the band’s history, the timeline will also make it easier for the users to navigate it.

                <br>
                <h4>Tour - tour.html</h4>
                The band wants to promote there concerts tours and other events to ensure that the most amount of people attend and
                hype is created. therefor we have made a simple navigation bar just for this page to ensure that users find what
                they are looking for fast. there is also a big picture to set the mood on the page and get you ready for some fun.
                Underneath there is a text describing different aspects of the tour/event and talking about why you should take the
                trip to come and see them. As an extra cool feature the map is interactive so you can press on your town at see the
                relevant information about that specific event and place an order.
                <br>
                <br>
                We believe that information is key in bringing people to the events. and that our older fans will find the information
                regarding why the tour or concert is held to be interesting. This page will be important as we believe that there is a
                fair percentile of our target demographic that is not active on social media, and will use this as their main source
                of information.

                <br>
                <h4>Blog - blog.html</h4>
                This page is meant to give the bands fans a more personal and less serious way of following them. this is a simple
                page that chronologically show what the band has been up to. every day the band and the team post on the blog talking
                about serious and less serious things related to the band. readers get to participate by liking posts and been able
                to add comments on specific entries in the blog.
                <br>
                <br>
                The thought is that fans will develop a greater loyalty to the band if they get to see and almost join in on the ups
                and downs of the band. There is also the possibility that fans will use the comments board to get in contact with each
                other and hype each other up. In the blog there are also great opportunities to advertise the merchandise sold on
                the site.

            Minimum Requirements
        </h2>
        <div class="text" >
            <p >
                Although the requirement only specify 4 distinct javascript implementations, we have included more than that as
                a challenge for ourselves, however, we might consider dropping some if the workload turns out beyond our
                expectations. With that being said, here is a list of our javascript implementations.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>buybutton.js</b>
                    <br>
                    This script will aid the users of this website to further their purchase. When clicked, a small window will
                    appear with forms for the users to type in their debit/credit card information, which allows our client to
                    gather necessary information to make the transactions. (The back end of this function is not in our scope.)
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>gallery.js</b>
                    <br>
                    A javascript function that lines the images in gallery.html to the bottom of the page then displays them
                    to the screen when chosen. The image-bar will take up 10% of the height of the screen and spans the whole
                    width of the window. Additionally, as more images are added to the gallery, the images will stack on top
                    of each other leaving the left part of the image exposed, so when hovering with the mouse over the image
                    will result in the image move to front to give the user a small preview.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>slideshow.js</b>
                    <br>
                    A function that switches the images in main.html over a certain amount of time (5 sec). And after the last
                    image the slideshow switches back to the first image so cycle begin again in a loop. We want the images to
                    reflect the state of the band by showing the latest festival or concert.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>comment.js</b>
                    <br>
                    A function that allows the users to comment to the band blog posts as well as read the other fans’ comment.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <b>play-music.js</b>
                    <br>
                    This function gives the users a chance to listen to some of our client’s music. We will include a play, a
                    pause and a stop button, also on the left side of these buttons is an animation indicating that the music
                    is playing. Our client want the users to be able to try the music before actually buying it.
                </li>

                <li>

                    This javascript function, similar to the buy button, will open a new tiny window to show informations
                    about the various city in a tour, what time and date and where it takes place. The users will also be
                    able to click on a link to transfer them to shop.html to purchase tickets for the concerts.

                    In about.html there would be a timeline which when clicked leads the users to the according events in the
                    band’s history. This is to create a cleaner and more intuitive experience for the users.

                Everyone on the group will have to follow the following plan which includes what to do and deadline for when to
                complete. The task are mostly divided by our organizational scheme, but we will make changes according to situation.
                To better control the course of our project, we would include two “control meetings” to gather together for follow
                up and organize possible changes.
