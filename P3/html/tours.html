                Opening on 10 Augst 2020, at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.
                Malcolm Young was replaced by his and Angus' nephew Stevie Young and Phil Rudd was replaced by
                their former drummer Chris Slade. They have both played for AC/DC on the Blow Up Your Video
                World Tour and on the Razors Edge World Tour, respectively. In Germany, the band set a new
                world record in the number of sold tickets within the shortest timespan, with more than
                300,000 tickets sold out in seventy-seven minutes.
                In Switzerland, the band set a new record in the duration
                to a 'sold out' concert. The concert in Zurich was sold out in 6 minutes (over 40,000 tickets). The band
                played
                at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, performing "Rock or Bust" and "Highway to Hell" on February 8, 2015.
                The last 22 shows
                were rescheduled as Brian Johnson was ordered to stop touring immediately.

            <p class="tour_text--paragraph">
                Ten shows from August 12, 2020 to August 22, 2020 were cancelled and had to be rescheduled, with Axl
                Rose of Guns N' Roses appearing in Johnson's place marking
                first time that AC/DC has featured a lead vocalist other than Brian Johnson since they concluded the
                Highway to
                Hell Tour on 27 January 1980. As part of this tour, AC/DC performed the first concert at the Olympic
                Stadium in London
                since its redevelopment following the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
                Longtime bassist Cliff Williams announced
                that he would retire upon completion of the tour, citing losing interest following the health issues
                with Malcolm Young
                and Brian Johnson, and the legal issues with Phil Rudd. The band broke their normal routine at the end
                of the final concert
                with Angus Young leading Williams out to the front of the stage to take a final bow. Rose also
                introduced the band members
                one by one.
