                    Opening on 10 Augst 2020, at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California. 
                    Malcolm Young was replaced by his and Angus' nephew Stevie Young and Phil Rudd was replaced by 
                    their former drummer Chris Slade. They have both played for AC/DC on the Blow Up Your Video 
                    World Tour and on the Razors Edge World Tour, respectively. In Germany, the band set a new 
                    world record in the number of sold tickets within the shortest timespan, with more than 
                    300,000 tickets sold out in seventy-seven minutes. 
                    In Switzerland, the band set a new record in the duration 
                    to a 'sold out' concert. The concert in Zurich was sold out in 6 minutes (over 40,000 tickets). The band played 
                    at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, performing "Rock or Bust" and "Highway to Hell" on February 8, 2015. The last 22 shows 
                    were rescheduled as Brian Johnson was ordered to stop touring immediately.

                    Ten shows from August 12, 2020 to August 22, 2020 were cancelled and had to be rescheduled, with Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses appearing in Johnson's place marking
                    first time that AC/DC has featured a lead vocalist other than Brian Johnson since they concluded the Highway to 
                    Hell Tour on 27 January 1980. As part of this tour, AC/DC performed the first concert at the Olympic Stadium in London
                    since its redevelopment following the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
                    Longtime bassist Cliff Williams announced 
                    that he would retire upon completion of the tour, citing losing interest following the health issues with Malcolm Young 
                    and Brian Johnson, and the legal issues with Phil Rudd. The band broke their normal routine at the end of the final concert 
                    with Angus Young leading Williams out to the front of the stage to take a final bow. Rose also introduced the band members 
                    one by one.
