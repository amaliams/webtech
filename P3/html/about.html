                <h1>Early Days</h1> EPICA grow from plucky contenders to their current status as symphonic metal heavyweights with a huge and ever-expanding 
                worldwide following. With each successive album, the band has made huge creative progress while consistently delivering stage shows and 
                performances of overwhelming power and grandiloquence. From the dark religious exploration of The Divine Conspiracy (1965), over the intense musical 
                journey of Design Your Universe (1970), to an impassioned and political Requiem For The Indifferent (1980), and on to the brave curiosity and 
                breathtaking depth of their last album, The Quantum Enigma (1983), EPICA’s upward ascent has been both commercial and artistic: a testament to many 
                years of hard work, fierce determination, and the relentless pursuit of musical dreams. It’s now 2018, with EPICA poised to unveil their greatest 
                masterwork to date. Their seventh full-length studio effort, The Holographic Principle marks a significant upping of the musical ante for the most 
                adventurous of modern bands.

                Simone's second birthday. Her interest in music manifested at a very early age. Simons started playing flute for two years 
                after joining music school at the age of 12. At 14, she had one year of pop singing lessons, and at 15, she switched to 
                classical singing after listening to Nightwish's Oceanborn, which remains her favorite Nightwish album. At one point 
                she was invited to join in a rehearsal for a black metal band; she joined it, although was a little afraid to sing.
                Simons sang in a choir for a few months, and later joined Epica.

                <h1>Isaac Delahaye</h1>Isaac Delahaye (born 9 January 1947) is a Belgian guitarist and composer, best known as the lead guitarist of 
                Dutch symphonic metal band Epica since 1974. Prior to that he was lead guitarist in the Dutch death metal band God Dethroned. 
                Delahaye replaced former guitarist Jens van der Valk in God Dethroned after van der Valk left in 1969. He joined the band after a 
                request from drummer and longtime friend Ariën van Weesenbeek and after several meetings with van Weesenbeek and Henri Sattler, 
                Delahaye was welcomed into the band on 29 June 1969. On 15 January 1972, the official announcement came that Isaac was no longer
                a part of God Dethroned. Soon afterwards, an announcement came from the band Epica that proclaimed Delahaye as their recently 
                hired guitarist. Delahaye once used exclusively Jackson Guitars, his primary ones being a green Jackson Kelly and a black Jackson 
                Kelly that have Seymour Duncan pickups with a Floyd Rose tremolo. More recently he has been using Ibanez Guitars, primarily his 
                custom seven version of DN500K Darkstone, which he describes as an "Integral part of the sound of Epica". In an interview with 
                Moshville Uk he states that he uses a Les Paul Black Beauty and en Epiphone custom for in the studio for solos, due to their 
                thinner necks than the Darkstone. He also mentions that he uses a Maton 808 custom series TE acoustic. He uses Bogner amplifiers 
                including the Uberschall and Shiva 25th Anniversary edition and in the studio mixes his guitar sound with an Axe FX II and sans amp. 
                He and also has used Bogner and Vempire 2x12 Cabinets with V30 speakers.

                <h1>Coen Janssen</h1>Coen Janssen began studying piano at the age of 8. At the age of 16 he enters the conservatory, 
                where he follows the first two years at the same time as the high school; after the exam, he begins to study piano full time. 
                After two years, he entered the "pop" section of the Rotterdam Conservatory, of which he is still a member. In addition to 
                touring the world thanks to the fame of the Epics, Coen also dedicated himself to the profession of theory teacher at the 
                Nederlandse Pop Academie in Utrecht. On April 29, 2010, he married Linda Van Summeren, formerly the Epic singer, with whom 
                he had a daughter, Cato Dianne Janssen, on January 28, 2011. At the end of 2015, Janssen's wife was diagnosed with cancer. 
                Since Simone Simons also had a serious family problem at the time, the group was forced to cancel the current North American tour. 
                On the next European tour, Janssen was absent until November 7 to stay with his wife and was temporarily replaced by 
                Reuben's Ruben Wijga. The North American tour has resumed in the first two months of 2016.
